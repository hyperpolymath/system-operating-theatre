* Instant-sync automation on push/release
* Technology governance policy (Hyperpolymath Standard)
* Repository structure
|===

== Phase 1: Specification & Design

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Status |⏳ Pending — specifications will be uploaded shortly

|Deliverables
a|
* [ ] Detailed feature specifications
* [ ] Architecture design documents
* [ ] API/CLI interface definitions
* [ ] Security model documentation

|===

== Phase 2: Core Implementation

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Status |🔲 Not Started

|Planned Features
a|
* [ ] *Health Checks Module*
** System resource monitoring
** Service status verification
** Disk/memory/CPU diagnostics
** Network connectivity checks

* [ ] *Multi-stage System Updates*
** Pre-update system snapshots
** Staged rollout with checkpoints
** Automatic rollback on failure
** Update verification and testing

* [ ] *Security Hardening*
** Firewall configuration automation
** SSH hardening
** User/permission auditing
** Compliance scanning (CIS benchmarks)

* [ ] *Remote Management (PSSH)*
** Parallel command execution
** Fleet inventory management
** Credential management (secure)
** Output aggregation and reporting
|===

== Phase 3: Integration & Packaging

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Status |🔲 Not Started

|Deliverables
a|
* [ ] Guix package definition (guix.scm)
* [ ] Nix flake (flake.nix) as fallback
* [ ] Container images (if applicable)
* [ ] Integration tests
* [ ] Documentation site
|===

== Phase 4: Release & Distribution

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Status |🔲 Not Started

|Deliverables
a|
* [ ] v0.1.0 initial release
* [ ] Release automation via instant-sync
* [ ] Changelog automation
* [ ] User documentation
|===

== Technology Decisions

[NOTE]
====
The original README.md references D language implementation (`dub build`).
The Hyperpolymath Standard in CLAUDE.md strongly favors Rust for CLI/systems work.

*Decision pending* — final implementation language to be confirmed in Phase 1 specifications.
====

=== Candidate Approaches

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Option |Pros |Cons

|*Rust*
|Aligns with Hyperpolymath Standard; excellent systems tooling; memory safety
|Steeper learning curve; longer compile times

|*D*
|Fast development; good systems programming; existing README reference
|Not in Hyperpolymath "preferred" list; smaller ecosystem

|*Hybrid*
|Core in Rust, scripting glue in ReScript/Gleam
|Added complexity; multiple build systems
|===

== Contributing

Contributions welcome once specifications are published. All contributions must:

* Follow the Hyperpolymath Standard (see `.claude/CLAUDE.md`)
* Include SPDX license headers
* Pass security requirements (no MD5/SHA1, HTTPS only, no secrets)
